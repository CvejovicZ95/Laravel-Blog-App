## Additional Notes

- User authentication is built using Laravel's built-in Auth scaffold (register, login, logout), which automatically handles user registration, login, and logout with all necessary middleware (`auth`). This approach leverages Laravel’s proven implementation, reducing potential errors and speeding up development.
- Route Model Binding is used for routes with model parameters, automatically injecting the relevant model instances into controllers. This approach reduces boilerplate code, improves readability, and eliminates the need for manual model retrieval.
- Frontend is implemented in React and is fully responsive across all screen sizes and devices.
